Lab 3 : Open a connection to Live Stream, count records, and calculate the stream rate
=================

For this lab, you will write code to do the following:

* Use your code or the solution from lab 2 to get an access token from the token API server and connection to the Live Stream API endpoint.
* Read individual hit records from the Live Stream connection and count the number of records received for at least 60 seconds.
* After at least 60 seconds, calculate the stream rate in records per seconds and print it to stdout.
* (Optional) Calculate the transfer rate in kbytes per seconds alongside the stream rate.

As before, you can choose to code in Java or Ruby. Feel free to use the skeletons or create your own directory structure - it's up to you. The solutions follow test driven development methodology and provide unit tests to test the goals for each coding exercise (hint: you should probably do this, too!).

Take a look at the [![credentials](../credentials)](../credentials) directory to see valid credentials and server URLs in classes you can include in your projects for both Ruby and Java.

Good luck! A working solution is available in [![solutions/lab3](../solutions/lab3)](../solutions/lab3)
